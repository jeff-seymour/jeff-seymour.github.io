        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
        </h2>
    <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people by giving them a greater understanding of how their brain works and develops. It is also an 
        inherently positive thing to understand because it helps the individual to realise their full potential through understanding 
        that their potential is not predefined or fixed but fluid and trainable. This is great for self esteem and having 
        an understanding of how the individual can train and sharpen their mind gives greater control on how they can go about doing it. <br>
        Read to an individual and they may pick up a key point, teach the individual to read and they can find all the points they need.

    <h2>
       Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
    </h2>
    <p>
        Noted previously it is my opinion that the thought of neuroplasticity is inherently positive. 
        The idea that as an individual I can continue to grow and learn without a natural cap or ceiling promotes the importance of personal accountability. 
        Neuroplasticity can also be looked at as a harsh reality when we do fail. Suddenly the reason isn’t that the material was too hard or I am naturally too stupid – the cause of the failure if simply because we didn’t do the work. 
        Understanding the repercussions of action (or lack of action) provides another motivator to do the work, build the pathways and increase our potential.

    <h2>
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
    </h2>
    <p>
        In order to increase your neuroplasticity you should exercise, rest and focus. <br>
        Physical exercise is important for overall health however you also need to specifically exercise your mind, this could come in the form of continued education or even just making an effort to keep reading. 
        You should keep well rested, again physically and mentally. Get your full nights sleep and where possible, dissipate unnecessary stresses.
        One way to do this is to consider the minutes to years of what you’re stressing about. 
        If the stress at hand will not matter in five years, give it the five minutes it needs today and then put it away. 
        If the matter won’t matter in just a year, just give it the minute is deserves and move on. <br>
        Finally, in order to increase your neuroplasticity you should keep a sharp focus. By setting a goal you give yourself something to strive for. In motorsport drivers focus on the end of the corner, they focus on the exit of racing line they need to take – they do not look at the corner, they do not look at the other cars. 
        If we can ignore the noise and focus on the goal we can keep ourselves sharp and ready – especially so if we are rested and educated to boot.

<h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>
        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
    </h2>
    <p>
        Growth mindset is a positive way to manage your own learning and development.
         It is very important because when learning new skills we will undoubtedly experience a whole host of knock backs and failures. 
         Growth mindset lets us turn these bad experiences into learning opportunities of their own and help us to continue developing our successes and knowledge.     
    </p>


    <h2>
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?  
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’ve been exposed to these positive thought strategies before so I did not experience much in the way of surprise however it is always great to re-cap these thought exercises. 
    </p>


    <h2>
        How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The most important integration of growth mindset for me is to carefully evaluate failures and mistakes as lessons rather than a reason to get into a negative mindset. 
        By learning from my mistakes I can grow my understanding and knowledge  around coding much faster than if I become problem focused.
