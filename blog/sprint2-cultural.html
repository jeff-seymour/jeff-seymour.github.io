        <h1>Dev Academy Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>My goal after succeeding with Dev Academy is to build a new career in tech. </h2>
<p>
    It’s always great to start with a sweeping generalisation but lets dig deeper. <br>
    Over the last six or so years I have built a successful career in Automotive, my passion for everything car related has worked well with my customer service and management experience to push me to some fantastic milestones. <br>
    I’ve seen big wins and big losses with the Auto trade. It has had me on fantastic highs and sweeping lows.
</p>
<p>
    There are however some big things that automotive lacks which includes work/life balance, growth and purpose.<br>
    Work life balance is very important, my latest role had me working 55-65 hours a week, 11 days per fortnight and on call every second week – very difficult to live around. <br>
    While big promises have always been made to me in Auto around development, it has not always come true and I have been left to attempt to continue my education outside of work hours. <br>
     Finally, I struggle to see the ‘why’ in everything I’ve done. <br>
     <br>
     I remember once sitting down for a drink after work with my sales and general manager, we were discussing the trade and the day gone by. <br>
     While discussing options to improve the business I made the comment that ultimately we were retail workers and could perhaps learn from that industry. <br>
     This didn’t go over very well and I suspect the reason is, these guys were working long hard hours as well and have done for a hell of a long time, to be compared to someone in a clothing store was likely seen as a slight against all that hard work. <br>
     The issue at hand though, is that all three of the people at that table have since left the industry or brand. <br>
     Yet shockingly, there are still Mercedes-Benz in Wellington and the world hasn’t collapsed.<br> It makes me wonder why I sacrificed so much of my social life, skipped meals or worked on my days off – beyond the odd vehicle I see on the street, I haven’t really done anything. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal going forward is to change that, I do not know where or when but somewhere, sometime I will fix or build something that improves my world or community in some way.    
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m bringing some pretty solid soft skills to the table, I’ve worked in customer service roles for over a decade and have seen some very diverse work places.<br> 
        My sales experience is important because one of the first things you must learn to be a successful salesmen is how to cope with, and move past, rejection and failure. <br>
        My technical experience and time spent working in operations should assist with problem solving and analytical thinking.<br>   
        <br>
        While I have a solid base to work from, I do have weaknesses. <br>
        My entry into a new role or skillset is never easy, I struggle to take those first few steps into the cold pool of new knowledge. <br> 
        Once I am in, I am fine but I tend to forget the struggle that got me there. <br> 
        What that means for me is that I look back on my previous work and think, gosh I was so good at that from day one, why am  I struggling here? <br> 
        The truth is, everything struggles at least a little, I need to keep my own expectations for myself in check and remember battles fought previous. <br> 
        My next glaring weakness is a lack of design ability, creativity is fine but putting an image down I struggle with, I am aware this will cause difficulty when it comes to the beautification of my work.
    </p>
    <p>
    Throughout this course I hope to really develop my team working skills, I am very used to working a ‘cog in the machine’ type teams but I believe this will require a closer cognitive connection than I have not needed in the past. <br> 
    This is part of why Dev Academy was so attractive to me, I feel it will help bridge that gap. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Managing my own weaknesses will be and has been difficult while working from home. 
        <br> In order to keep myself in check I intend on making better use of a Pomodoro timer and keeping myself on target more often. 
        <br> I work best early morning and in the evening, 6-10am and 6pm-1am.  
    </p>
    <p>
        While tempting to simply work in these hours, it would cost me significant ‘life’ time which long term will be detrimental.<br> 
        Over Sprint 2 I have tried to ‘hold myself to the flame’ as much as possible but it isn’t really sustainable.<br> 
        I intend on capitalising on my early morning productivity and allowing myself some free time mid day to catch up on chores and lunch. <br>
        Time lost can be made up in short night time spurts and some weekend morning catch ups.<br> 
        I will focus more closely on my time boxes and the actual requirements of the course rather than focusing on smaller details.   
    </p>
    <p>
        From the facility team I do not have huge expectations currently as I work from home but I am confident they are available for assistance when needed. <br> 
        My current issue I suppose is not knowing, what it is that I do not know. <br>
         In order to keep on track, I will make a commitment to complete certain points by certain times and if I am pushing too far behind I will ask for assistance before it is too late.
        <br> Had I done that last week, I might not be submitting this late!  
    </p>
    <p>
        My schedule commitments must be structured to work around when I am most productive and cover outside commitments as efficiently as possible. <br> 
        While I do value and see the importance of absolute dedication to completing my studies, I feel it is important for my mental health to maintain other interests as well. <br>
        Such as socializing and working on a few projects I have ongoing.
