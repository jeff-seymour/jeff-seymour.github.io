        <h1>Task: Share an example of working with others when there is resistance or tension</h1> 
        <p>
            A career in a workshop environment but can extremely stressful. <br>
            You have to deal with conflicting personal and professional agendas. <br> Loud noises, dirt, dust, smells and grease. Tensions run high, people yell, scream and throw things. <br>
            Customers are losing money and paying for the privilege so they are stressed, angry and sometimes scared. <br>
            Your stock and tools are often very high value, it isn’t uncommon for a technician to have $50,000 or more invested in a tool chest, what happens if you scratch it or even touch it? <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important personal trait to have in a workshop environment is precision and failing precision, decisiveness. 
                <br> I’ve seen a truck box body lowering on a co-workers neck, a man with children and a wife at home an inch from death. 
                <br> I’ve seen 30 ton trucks come within centimetres of dropping into work pits and I’ve seen half million dollar vehicles come within moments of being hoisted on crumple zones. <br>
                On the more mundane side, I’ve seen simple decisions ignored while more pressing matters are dealt with.

                <p>
                    If we are talking at your desk and I gesture wildly, knocking your drink bottle over, what do you do?<br>
                    The water is pouring out, your laptop, phone, notebook and wallet are on the desk.<br>
                    It is my fault this is happening, but what do you do?<br>
                    Some people get mad, why would you do this? <br>
                    Some, sad – how could you do this? <br>
                    Others feel shock, why and how could this happen? <br>
                    All of these reactions, while natural, are wrong. The who, what, where and why do not matter. <br>
                    Pick up the water bottle before more water comes out, move anything that could be damaged, clean up the water. Then, if you must, argue over the spilt water, or better yet, move on.  <br>
                    Problems should be identified, rectified and prevented rather than stumbled upon, argued about and deferred. <br>
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Until recently I worked for a Truck servicing agent in Wellington, in the parts supply team. <br>
                        Due (in my opinion) to mismanagement our parts holding was growing, about 15% per year. <br>At this stage in 2018 we held around $450,000 in truck and trailer parts stock. <br>Items ranged in value from as little as a few cents to $20,000+<br>
                        <br>
                        Our stock holding grew but our stock storage hadn’t changed in many years, this led to a very clear issue. We had parts everywhere and everything was a mess. <br>
                        <br>
                        Prior to my joining the company this issue was identified and a solution put forward by our national parts manager who was Auckland based. <br>The workshop had a portion of their floor plan which was positioned in a way where it was difficult to use and therefore rarely used. <br>His suggestion, tape off the section and use it as parts storage. <br>When I joined the company two years later, this had still not happened.<br> It was mentioned to me on my starting and I regularly chased the two department managers to make a decision where this line of tape would go, neither could make a call. <br>
                        <br>
                        Eight or so months later the matter came up in an operations meeting with the national manager, he wasn’t particularly happy nothing had happened however now presented a new solution. <br>The stock had continued to grow and our storage had not. <br>
                        <br>
                        Meanwhile our workshop was completing less engineering work and had less equipment on hand. <br>
                        <br>
                        His suggestion, repurpose a portion of the engineering room as parts storage. <br>
                        <br>
                        Another six or so months go by and still, nothing has happened. I’ve chased my own manager and our service manager for an answer. <br>“Where is the line, what are the dimensions, what can I do?” <br>
                        Nothing, even our national parts manager who had the idea in the first place wouldn’t make a decision as he said it wasn’t his place.<br>
                        <br>
                        One day we were unusually quiet. <br>
                        <br>
                        I picked up the yellow and black hazard tape I’d ordered so many months ago, walked to the engineering room, pushed tooling, sheet and scrap metal around and placed a line of tape directly in the middle of the room, along the floor and as high up the walls as I could. <br>
                        <br>
                        Next I returned to the office and sent an email to both managers, explaining I had made a call on the split of the engineering room and anything on the parts storage side would be disposed of in two weeks unless it were sellable. <br>
                        <br>
                        Both managers came back to me and effectively said OK, how much space have you taken? <br>
                        <br>
                        To the service manager I responded, ‘heaps, most of it in fact’ <br>
                        <br>
                        To the parts manager, ‘Not much at all – it might not even help’ <br>
                        <br>
                        Quickly, things got exciting. Everyone was angry and while they were saying much the same things I do not think they realised they were angry about different factors. <br>
                        “Jeff why have you done this? Why are you so self-centered? Why didn’t you let us make a decision? Jeff, the world is ending and is your fault!” (I’m Jeff) <br>
                        In a big huff, we all marched down to the engineering room. We were meet on the way by the leading hand “who moved the welder!” he demanded to know – meanwhile Mark was furious because Dave said Shane saw Jeff move a piece of scrap metal he has been meaning to take home – absolute pandemonium. <br>
                        <br>
                         Pandemonium however, was my victory.
                        <br>
                        For the first time in three years, we had engagement on the issue. By taking blind action I forced the hands of the interested party and locked them into discussion. 
                        We stood in the engineering room and argued, ‘its not enough!’ says the parts manager, ‘its far too much!’ says the service manager. <br>
                        <br>
                        ‘The welder goes here, not there!’ says the foreman, Mark is still yelling ‘Don’t touch my things!’ 
                        <br>
                        Eventually we all agreed that the line was in the wrong place and that it was time for action, the workshop agreed to move their trash, scrap and tooling out one side of the room and I was tasked with relocating some bulky items in. Admittedly I still had to ‘assist’ moving some items out but ultimately I had forced a resolution. We agreed to revisit and move the line once the stock rotation was complete.
                        <br>
                        The line is still in the same place nine months later.
                        <br>
                        There are many reasons why this issue was deferred. It was too inconsequential to worry about when bigger things were happening. It was too important to get wrong. It was someone else’s job. Not now, tomorrow.<br>
                        That water bottle sat on its side on the desk pouring water for three long years before someone thought to pick it up.<br>
                        In future, I hope to always pick up the water bottle. <br>
                        I hope to stop the flow and clean up the mess rather than stare and stress. <br>
