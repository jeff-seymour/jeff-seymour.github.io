How can I describe the differences of HTML and CSS?
HTML is a life well lived, hard work and fair pay leads to a decent life, or a functional project. <br>
CSS adds flavour, HTML is the labour which leads to a fair income, CSS is the fine whisky and cuban cigar on the friday night.<br> 
CSS is the colour and visual structure to an otherwise boring page. HTML gives you the info you need but CSS makes it more worth reading. <p>

Control flow dictates the order in which statements or functions are executed. <br>
Imagine I asked you to vist the grocey store for me. 'Pack the shopping into the re-usable bags, drive down in the Mazda, here - use my credit card. Oh! get butter and panko crumbs!'
Would you do these things in the order specified? of course not, you need a form of control to be actioned on this workflow. <br>
For you and me, this comes in the form of common sense //(ie drive down in the mazda, pick up butter and panko, pay on my credit card and pack into the re-usable bags)<br>
For the command line, this comes in the form of proper coding and control flow. 
<br> Loops are and/or statements which make sure all of the work gets done. If you arrived home I may ask wheres the butter?<br>
If you do not have it, drive down in the mazda, pick up butter, pay on my credit card, pack into re-usable bags. <br>
If you do have it, move onto the next task, simple! <br>

        The DOM is the layout of a page. Think of a webpage as a series of stacked boxes - as if you just lost a game of horiztonal tetris.<br>
        Each box contains some form of information although it may be as simple as white space or text. <br>
        These boxes are stacked and arranged in such a manor that they build the web pages we use day to day <br>
        While you may not realise it, you interact with the DOM everytime you visit a webpage. <br>

 In programming, an object is a 'thing' while an array is a 'cluster' <br>
 One object can have many descriptive factors however is a single entity of its own. An array however is a cluster of individual objects organized as if they are a set together. <br>
 Imagine a social club, John is an object of that social club, he is overweight, sunburnt and boisterous - yet he is still just himself. An object of the social club. <br>
 On the other side of the room stand Harry, Sally, Kelly and Colonel Sanders, they are an array of club members <br> 
 when we access data from an array we are looking at a range of data while when looking at objects we are looking at defining factors of a specific item. <br>

    Javascript functions are a block of code designed to initiate a set task. They are useful because they have a set functionality which allows the person working on the code <br>
    to understand expected outcomes, whether they created the code initially or simply came into the work later.
