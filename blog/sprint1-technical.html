    <h1>ID vs Class explained with fantasy tropes </h1>
    <h3>Have you ever played a game, read a book or seen a film with fantastic heroes who complete epic quests and combat evil? <br>
    If you have, this should make a lot of sense! If not - I am sure you'll follow along just fine anyway</h3>
</header>
<p>
  The purpose of this page is to provide an easily understood explanation of the difference between ID and Class in an HTML setting.
  In order to push this point across, I have elected to use a narrative focused around common fantasy tropes. <br>
  If some of these tropes do not make sense to you, <em>you likely had more friends than me in primary school.</em>
</p>

<p>
Imagine if you will, you live in a fantastical world, full of terror and potential - somewhere strange and foreign, like Palmerston North. <br>
In this world only one person may have a certain name at a time, this is just like an ID tag.<br>
Your name is Ignacio, this is like an ID tag and is unique to you. <br>
Originally, your name was actually Sharleen however when you named, unbeknownst to your parents there was another Sharleen just down the road <strong>who was born and allocated the name (ID) Sharleen first.</strong> <br>
Shortly after naming you, your fabulously wealthy parents passed away which is swell because now you inherit their riches right?<br> 
<strong>Wrong- big wrong!</strong> Because another person has taken the ID Sharleen after you, the riches will be allocated to that sharleen instead.<br>
Why? because King & Queen css say so! <br>

Now technically sharing an ID is no big deal however it can be confusing sometimes and can lead to unexpected situations in different environments. <br>
<br>For example, when the above code was run on my machine using Google Chrome, I had the following result which in our analogy would have seen a 50/50 split - truly unreliable!<br>
<img src="../Images/sharedriches.png" width="500" height="600"> <br>
For this reason it is accepted and best practice to only apply an ID tag once - What does this mean for you? Well now you're a penniless orphan. Goodluck!<br>
To add insult to injury, you are forced to change your name and choose Ignacio. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Years later, you've somehow survived and decided to become an Adventurer. <br>
  You'll need a way of defending yourself and choose to be a warrior, looking for work you travel to the warriors guild in Bigtown City <br>
  There are now three aspects to your character, your ID which is Ignacio and two class tags, Adventurer and warrior. <br>
  At the warriors guild, you meet many other warriors but no other Ignacios<br>
  Some of the warriors are also mages, priests and/or birdpeople - anyone can have multiple Classes but of course, only one ID.<br>
  Time goes by and the King and Queen css make a ruling that those of Warrior class must wear yellow <br>
  The mages guild down the road make fun until the King and Queen make a ruling that all mages must teleport anyone who touches them to another place <br>
  The big losers here are the Warriors who are also mages, they are now yellow and must teleport people <br>
  This shows how having multiple classes can impose multiple rules on a single person or group. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Some time goes by and there is a new ruling made, all Warriors must now wear Violet and all Jonathans must wear turquoise. <br>
  You're startled when you enter the mess hall and your good friend Jonathan has left his violet armour at home and is wearing a blue-green instead. <br>
  There is no reason to be afraid, he isnt breaking the law -yes he is a Warrior and should be wearing Violet however he is also the one and only Jonathan (ID vs Class)<br>
  ID takes priority over Class, Jonathan is a warrior/mage so while he must still teleport people, his ID tag rule overrides the class tag rule <strong> because ID has priority over Class</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
  Years pass by and your reputation grows, you're very busy and it can be difficult to find you <br>
  You pay a mage to produce a block which when touched, teleports the user directly to you. <br>
  This is only possible with an ID and is a good example of the few important features of an ID<br>
  It is worth noting that not every entity which carries a class has to carry an ID or vice versa. <br>
  This means a fellow with the ID Peterson who lives in Bigtown City could have no 'occupation' - no Class tag<br>
  Likwise you could have a Warrior/Mage/Cheerleader who doesnt have an ID - I suppose in this analogy that would be some form of Golem<br>
  Below is a break down of your eventual list of Classes, note that there is only one ID but multiple classes<br>

</p>
<p>
  Hopefully by now you're nodding your head in some form of enlightment, if not, let me put this a little simpler; <br>
  An ID should be unique in each code, it should never be used more than once due to potential conflicts whereas a class can be used all over if needed <br>
  Classes can stack, you can have multiple classes but only one ID. <br>
  ID does have some functionality which Class does not, generally it should only be used in order to implement said functions<br>
  An example of this is pulling the user down to a specific section of a web page.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, it is worth mentioning that you may not need ID or Class at all, unlike a name which almost everyone has, ID and Class are only applied when you wish to implement additional functionality.
