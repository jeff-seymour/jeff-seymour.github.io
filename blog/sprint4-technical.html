    <p>
It is hard for me to recall a specific single problem during this sprint, likely because the entire journey was a large complicated problem. <br>
A large part of this sprint was a Javascript Kata, this involves working through challenges over and over again to cement basic ideas. <br>
I hate to admit that I think those basic ideas are far from cemented and are instead floating around the ether of my subconscious. 
</p>
<p>
The real trouble I've had is quite literally a language barrier. <br>
Sometimes you can see the answer but you do not know how to articulate it<br>
It is a bit like when you travel and suddenly something simple like ordering lunch becomes an exam you must study for a stress over<br> 
<br>
In order to solve these 'foreign language' issues I employed as many problem solving methods as possbile. <br>
I began by outlining the basic funciton of what I need to do, this is called Pseudocode. Rather than tackle the task as a whole, I broke it down into manageable setions<br>
Once I had my road map, I started googling the problem to find the correct syntax and trying anything which looked at least almost correct. <br>
I paid close attention to my error messages and used them to ID the specific line or figure at fault and work from there. <br>
When really stuck it helps to explain the issue outloud, this is called the 'Rubber Ducky method' - I dont have a duck but I annoyed the hell out of my cats. I even spent some time talking to one of my cars <br>
When really stuck, I reached out for help within my co-hort, we have a great bunch of people here and there is always someone willing to lend a hand. <br>
The final problem solving technique I employed is more related to mental healthiness. I'm unsure if it has an offical name but I call it the easy win strategy. <br>
Perhaps you've noted that 'wins' or successes often come in a cluster? You're able to jump from one victory to the next which puts you in a great mental state and helps you proceed. <br>
Easy win strategy is employed when you're in a rut and feel you cant move. Its time to put down the hard task and knock over some easy ones, respond to some emails or do the dishes. <br>
I mowed my lawns and learnt to ride a motorcycle during this sprint, easy wins to build confidence for those hard battles.
